Ecosystems allow data to be processed for whatever reason, as well as be fun

Tech tries give rates, and other resources from elements, as rewards to the sets that first possess the element.

This creates competition so that it makes sense to block another thing from getting a goal so that the first thing can be getting more rates.


# Plants and grazers

Plants and grazers are shaped sets in a set that is filled with editables made from conversions

Grazers can move around between sets, and the plants do not move at all.

These read the attributes in the editables, getting first elements to tech trees

Plants do not use api for long periods, they are more efficient that way, they just wait until an editable hits it.

Plants can bud off and get out of the map, and travel to be set on the ground in another map

Grazers use much more api moving around and finding stuff.

# secondary level

Other sets look around for the plants and grazers, and enter their space and set the tech element attributes to process it further.
If there are multiple attributes to set, then the last one to set it gets the next tech tree advancement element.

And they can feed on the rates.

The older tech element will go away, and the thing that last provided the needed attribute will own the newly created tech element 

# higher 

A set can be both a plant and grazer and secondary level, to process the element in the same set.
Some tech tress can demand the tech element change ownership before giving a new element.

Regardless, if the set possessing the tech element cannot meet its requirements by doing the correct stuff, to be validated by the remote or script,
then there are no rewards, and they take up api usage.

Some tech elements can give api rate increases, by possessing an element for allowing it, and api rates can be reduced for things that do not move the tech elements.
When a set has no more api, it is removed.

Api call limits given by goals can be distributed to other sets that work together.
