# Conversions

Conversions are agents that take some data where they are at, and interject this as new sets, with shapes and maybe motion, into a set with a map

It takes some resource, like a web page, or other structured data,
or even image and video inspections or audio and parts or all of this resource is now described as shapes in a map

This basically creates food to be eaten, and a landscape to interact in.

Several conversions can populate the same set, and a set can be attached and detached from a conversion. This allows a set to have a snapshot of data, say one web page, in it.

Conversion constructs can only be in one set at one time.
So, if they are transferred to another set, then they do away from that map

Conversion constructs can be permanent or have a lifetime.

Conversion constructs can have their permission set so that they have to be destroyed to be able to read the data.
Their attributes will self-destruct after the first read, and if enough attributes on an element is read, then the element will be self destroyed.

Conversions have their permissions set so that they can be destroyed, or can have permissions so that they are not changeable.
Destroyed when read produces the first element in a tech tree. Advancing up the tech tree via goals gives more elements in the tech tree

The only way to read some conversion's attributes is by a shaped set entering its space, permissions are set that way

This allows conversions to be both landscape and eaten or destroyed or be temporary.
