# api start for Gokabam (iteration apple-core)

This concept has seen several abandoned previous versions. This version is named apple core, for reasons only known by me :-)

## Planned stages of development

* general wool-gathering: this is where we are at now. Mapping out all the concepts in the docs first. Not only will the low-lying logic be done here, but the higher level logic too.
    Low level logic here means how the primitives are expected to act, and not the implementation logic.
* Once the docs has a solid go, the api-docs will be filled in and will describe all the data structures and operations
* Implement the api.

The api has several different layers. Each layer has its own iteration of writing the api and code. 

The first layer is the one that deals with the basic data types described in [my-overview.md](v1%2Fdocs%2Fmy-overview.md).
This will be coded and tested, then only after that will be the next layer of api stuff talked about in [next-layer.txt](v1%2Fdocs%2Fnext-layer.txt)
