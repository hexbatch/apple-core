# Api docs for Gokabam (iteration apple-core)

This concept has seen several abandoned previous versions. 
This version is named apple core, because it's been eaten at for a while, but has a lot of great seeds that can turn into valuable orchards later.

This repo is meant to contain api definitions for the gokabam project. 
This includes high level overviews and docs. The implementation of the code can be in different repos.

## What is this?

In plain english this is a general approach to sharing information and doing sales between different people.
This is designed to work as a stand-alone server but also be able to work between servers run by different people.

I plan to use this to do my own sales and services. However, the more people who use this to set up their own stuff, the better off my plans will be. 
So this is why its open source. Also, I have hopes that fresh ideas, and tested concepts and sales by others can be mixed into my own plans. 


## Planned stages of development

This project is still in the most early days. Right now, it's still in the planning.
There will be a core api that will power 25 microservices.

The status now is: mapping out all the concepts in the docs first. 
 
When the concepts are done,  I will do the open api in this project also.

Once the open api docs are done, the first coding will start, and more documents will be added to this repo.
There will be links to test and explore.
