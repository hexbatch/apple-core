# Hexbatch plans

This is the future home of the api documents for the hexbatch open source project.

This is a baby project. Many things are still growing as ideas. It is not meant for people to easily read through right now.

Eventually, this repo will include an open api spec with readable,detailed explanations and docs.
At this stage, is just a growing set of requirements.


## What is this?

Here, data and interactions are represented as elements in sets.

It's hoped to create new types of connections between online users, their transactions and interactions.

One goal here is to share information, and facilitate services and access, across different platforms and servers.
It can be seen as a glue connecting disparate systems.

This is my own approach on how I want to do logic in systems. So this is more than web apps.

Many concepts in here have been used in previous versions.
This version is named apple core: because it's been eaten at for a while, but has a lot of great seeds that can turn into valuable orchards later.



## Planned stages of development

This project is still being planned : when finished it will have a core api that will power many microservices.

The microservices and core are being designed together. Once there are api definitions for all, the core will be coded.

Timeline is:
* mapping out concepts
* do open api specs
* coding the core
* coding the services


see [the version 1 index for more info](v1/v1_index.md)

## Contributions

Pull requests will gladly be accepted after the first version will be coded. This is currently a solo project guided by artistic inspiration!
