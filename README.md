# Api docs for Gokabam (iteration apple-core)

This repo is meant to contain api definitions for the gokabam project.
This includes high level overviews and docs. The implementation of the code can be in different repos.

Many concepts in here has seen several abandoned previous versions. 
This project version is named apple core: because it's been eaten at for a while, but has a lot of great seeds that can turn into valuable orchards later.


## What is this?

In plain english this is a general approach to sharing information and doing transactions that can include sales.
This is designed to work as a stand-alone server but also be able to work between servers run by different people.


This library is being written to reflect how I do business and ideas.
I plan to use this to do my own sales and services, and empower my future projects.
Other people might find this useful (or not).  I think it could have a broad use case should people want to code similar to me. 
More people using this will empower me. And the way I think of it, I would hope its used ways I never intended or planned. 

So this is why its open source.



## Planned stages of development

This project is still in the most early days. Right now, it's still in the planning.
Later, there are plans to have a core api that will power 25 microservices.

The status now is: mapping out all the concepts in the docs first. 
 
When the concepts are done,  I will do the open api specs.

Once the open api docs are done, the first coding will start, and more documents will be added to this repo while I work on that.
Later, there will be more links to test and explore. Please remember this is a baby project. Many things are growing here.
There are more plans than substance at this time.
