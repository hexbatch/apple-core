# Hexbatch plans

This is the future home of the api documents for the hexbatch open source project.

This is a baby project. Many things are still growing as ideas. It is not meant for people to easily read through right now.

Eventually, this repo will include an open api spec with readable,detailed explanations and docs.
At this stage, is just a growing set of requirements.


## What is this?

Many concepts in here have been used in previous versions.
This version is named apple core: because it's been eaten at for a while, but has a lot of great seeds that can turn into valuable orchards later.



## Planned stages of development

This project is still being planned



see [the version 1 index for more info](v1_index.md)

## Contributions

Pull requests will gladly be accepted after the first version will be coded. This is currently a solo project guided by artistic inspiration!
