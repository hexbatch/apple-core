# Api docs for Gokabam (iteration apple-core)

This repo is meant to contain api definitions for the gokabam project.
This includes high level overviews and docs. The implementation of the code can be in different repos.

Many concepts in here have been used in previous versions. 
This version is named apple core: because it's been eaten at for a while, but has a lot of great seeds that can turn into valuable orchards later.


## What is this?

In plain english this is a way for sharing information and doing transactions that can include sales.
This is designed to work as a stand-alone server but also be able to work between servers run by different people.


This library is being written to reflect how I do business and ideas.
Other people might find this useful (or not).  I think it could have a broad use case should people want to code similar to me. 
This is open source.



## Planned stages of development

This project is still being planned : a core api that will power 27 microservices.

Now is mapping out concepts, then open api specs, then coding: first the core, then the services.  


When the coding starts more documents will be added. And, there will be more links to test and explore.
Please remember this is a baby project. Many things are growing here.
There are more plans than substance at this time.

see [the version 1 index for more info](v1/v1_index.md)

## Contributions

Pull requests will gladly be accepted after I code the first version
