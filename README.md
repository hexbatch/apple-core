# Api docs for Gokabam Apple Core

Here are current working plans for a new system which helps share information, 
and facilitate interactions, across different platforms and servers.

This is a work in progress. Many concepts in here have been used in previous versions.
This version is named apple core: because it's been eaten at for a while, but has a lot of great seeds that can turn into valuable orchards later.

There will be no code here: only discussions, documentation and api call definitions.
This includes high level overviews and docs. The implementation of the code will be in other repos.
After the coding starts, those will be added here, along with links for testing and tutorials.



## Planned stages of development

This project is still being planned : when finished it will have a core api that will power many microservices.

The microservices and core are being designed together. Once there are api definitions for all, the core will be coded.

Timeline is:
* mapping out concepts
* do open api specs
* coding the core
* coding the services

This is currently looking like a multi-year project.
Now, this is a baby project. Many things are growing here.
There are more plans than substance at this time.

see [the version 1 index for more info](v1/v1_index.md)

## Contributions

Pull requests will gladly be accepted after the first version will be coded. This is currently a solo project guided by artistic inspiration!
