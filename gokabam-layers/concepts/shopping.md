# Using elements for shopping

When someone shops, elements can be distributed for friend lists on social media.
The seller can arrange that the friends combine their coupons to get a good deal next time people shop.

How do people combine their coupons? They give it to their friend.

They can give the elements to their friend without logging in, because if they do not have an account, the elements are still in a pool not created yet
An agent is created that will apply the ownership for those new elements to the buyer.

However, to give it to someone else other than the buyer, they have to sign up or log in
Then, any of their elements will be owned by them, and they can send it anywhere.
Again, this is done via an agent in the website doing this.
