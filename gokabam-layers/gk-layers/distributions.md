# Distributions

Organizes new elements and element pools,  given to users and and network entities

Sets up mixes of element types of different amounts of elements to be released when an awarded offer succeeds

Sets up a template to use, so that when a user buys something, then some or all of their associated-network gets the new elements
* Their associated network can contain users who have these network identities

When a user gets the elements, the new elements from the pool, or the elements taken from a set are given to them, they have ownership.

When it's a non-user network entity:
* the element sub-pool is assigned it, to be instantiated when a user claims/is assigned this entity in their identity-networks
* the elements and pool is added as a possession set, so cannot be sold 
* the possession set can have limits to expire, and release any already created elements, or the pool
