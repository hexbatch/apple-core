# Reason of being

Everyone has their unique way of seeing the world:
we associate different thought processes and explanations to the same everyday objects we all share.

Then we learn to work, and make things, and use tools.
I have long struggled with my programming tools because, while I can make beautiful stuff,
they do not reflect so much who I really am or how I think.

Instead, I have often just molded myself to the technology and used it. This came at a cost.
However, now, I am trying to change that a little.
Apple core is important to me because it helps me move my world better, 
and gives me some tools that fits better with my personality.

This set of code might not be so important to most people: might not click with the majority. 
But, beauty is in the eye of the beholder. And just like walking in a nice fitting pair of shoes, 
it does make for a better job done.
Tools that fit us better help produce better things.

# Starting description

A good description for this library is that it describes things, and these things can go into groups of things.
The things can themselves become ways to organize other things.

So:
* things 
  * (tokens, token types) 
* the descriptions
  * (attributes)
* groups of things 
  * (sets, token sets, set operations)


## A story

A run down of a use case here is that I have a bag of marbles to give to my friend Jim. 
What follows is a crazy story, totally made up, that illustrates what the library does in the code.

Some of the marbles are green, some red,  and some decide on a color when you look at it each time.
The color might be different if you look at it outside the bag, or when the marble is in Jim's possession.
Two marbles only exist at half past ten o'clock in the morning, for 5 minutes.
And half the marbles will drop out of the bag when Jim goes down a certain street, but not the other streets.

When Jim goes home, and adds these marbles to the others he has, one marble then unlocks a video on his phone. 
And another marble goes gray forever, and makes a stink.
He will have to throw that one out.

Because Jim now has 5 red marbles,
Jill can now start her car and get milk from the store. 
On the way back, she steals one of Jim's marbles, so she can get her door unlocked.
Once back inside, she throws away the marble, and the same marble is now back in Jim's bag,
and also in the cash register at the church bake off. An elderly Gentleman, Sam, used that to buy bread ten minutes ago.
He could not have done that without Jim loosing his marble for a little bit.

Sam, Jill, and Jim do not know each other and live far apart.


## What we can learn from the story

* That tokens have boundaries in time and location. 
They can stop existing if they are out of their boundaries, and exist again.
* Tokens have attributes, that can be constant, 
but can also be calculated based on what set they belong to, and where they are at, and what other tokens are in the same set.
* The same token can exist in multiple sets, owned by different people. 
The tokens can turn themselves, or others in the same set, or the same token in all sets, off and on or other, based on who owns the set, and several other things. 
* Tokens can unlock stuff, lock stuff or do other actions


## Cool story bro, but how does this help anything at all?

What helps me with this library is I can insert it into already used tech stacks,  web pages, form of communication and transactions.

We represent existing stuff with tokens, and manipulate those tokens in sets shared in different ways by people, to make the stuff do things.

The library allows new ways of social collaboration to act as control boards for things.
