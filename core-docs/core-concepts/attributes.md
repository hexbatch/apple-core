# Attributes in the core

An attribute is a tag that has a name and a value. 

Attributes have conditions, called bounds, where they do not exist.

Attributes can control which users can read or write to them.

Attributes have parents.

Attributes can be made to be incompatible with some other attributes. Or made to need other attributes to work.

Attributes can make rules about what sets their element can be inside.


One or more attributes are used in a type,
a type makes elements which use the attribute rules and behaviors
An element can have many attributes, and they can be grouped into different clusters on the element, by having them come from different parents.
