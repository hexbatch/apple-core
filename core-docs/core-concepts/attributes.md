# Attributes in the core

An attribute is a tag that has a name and a value.

Attributes also have conditions, called bounds, where they do not exist.

And attributes can be made to be incompatible with some other attributes. Or made to need other attributes to work.

Attributes have permissions about who can read and write to them.

Additionally, attributes can make elements move around different sets based on what they are most compatible.

AN element can have many attributes, and they can be grouped into different clusters on the element, by having them come from different parents.
