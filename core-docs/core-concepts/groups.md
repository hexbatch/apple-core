# Groups in the core


A user group has members and admins. Admins can add or remove members. In many cases, the admins can do more than the users.

Each user has his own default user group for permissions about what he makes. This is written the admin group for the user.

But other groups can be made by the user to help set attribute,remote and type permissions
