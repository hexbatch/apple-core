# How to see the state of the system?

Often in building and testing, it is good to see a visual representation of the total state of the system

A web page can be made to get the resources to look at, and display them. There are attributes for display each element can have.

Here we can call the api to get all the json of all resources seen by a user:
bounds, type, attributes, remotes, types, elements, sets, mutuals, interfaces, pipes

We show this in 3d , with the different connections, and be able to navigate through the model of it
