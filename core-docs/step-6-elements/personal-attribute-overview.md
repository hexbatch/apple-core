# Personal attributes

Any user can attach their attributes to any element they can see. Nobody but the user's group can see those attributes.

Personal attributes do not change except they can turn off if bounds or allergies are in effect.
Neither do the personal attributes affect the behavior of what they are pointing to.
If an element has changes to never let it be seen by the user, then the personal attribute is kept.

Personal attributes can be used via the search to get a list of elements they point to. They only return what can currently be seen.


When an element is deleted, so is the personal attribute
