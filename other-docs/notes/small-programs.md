# Mechanisms: small programs/patterns the remotes can call to do stuff:


## state machine
if an attribute on an element changes value, then change contents of sets by removing or adding pre-planned elements based on that attribute value
    or use group agg operations

## build set linkages
sets added to a set, and on entering the set will add a common element to make them mutual
or links them
when enough sets links/mutuals made job is done, like an enzyme
