# Interfaces

Interfaces are made up of two parts that connect to the api. An agent, to change some elements that reflect the state of what the interface is representing.
And watchers to tell it when something outside the interface changes, such as a command to do something

It can listen for commands and do tasks, and also report back data.

An interface can be represented by its own set (because it is an agent), and can react when elements join this set.
Users joining this set can execute commands on this interface

# Connecting this api to physical devices 

An interface can be connected to devices to enable communication between them, or the api.
They can have a common set where elements drift through the set relationships. Slow moving messages.


# Connecting to browser environment

Interfaces in the browser can allow some data the user sees or bookmarks, to be converted to elements and do stuff in the wider api.
There can be hubs where people comment on news articles or other postings via boards. These hubs can be seen in the browser or an app,
and then it's easy to participate and read the boards about the site being visited
