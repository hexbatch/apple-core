# Coding with elements

There can be listeners, that listen to changes, and they change elements, which can set off other listeners.
As the elements drift between sets and instances, there can be chains of these event listeners and element changes.

But elements can also interact with other elements directly, in a set, and there can be loops and conditions and values exchanged.
These interactions can exist in one set or many, and these interactions might want to require catalysts, other elements that tell them to start doing this.
Catalysts can also speed up the interactions, or rate limit them

## advanced element programming

* travel of the different parts to a destination
* creating shells, popping and returning
* shell stacks
* enzymes that will do stuff after they have an element-set existing in the same set
* code lines and branches
