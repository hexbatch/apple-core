# Data Flow and navigation

Elements can move themselves though a set relationships to find the best fit.
This movement is not very fast, but it happens.

## Exploration

It's possible to set an element that drifts to find its natural balance, or to change sets according to a pattern.
Actions on the element can do a search in the current set, and report back a format, or do other things

## Mechanisms

Using the allergy and affinity, predefined elements can route themselves through a network of set relations to find the needed destination.

The user element can take a ride using this, to do exploring. By picking up an attribute, or set of attributes, to do the exploring,
the user can give permission for these attributes to be added or removed.

## Set guarding

It's possible to make sets made that require visiting other sets first before the element is allowed to come in.
This allows a traffic and control flow to be set up. And also very slow moving programs can execute this way by being elements going through sets

## Visitors

A set can have an action that listens to an element's entry event to that set. 
The remote that gets this call can write elements to the visitor's working set, if it finds it's a user element.
These new elements can be a command pallet to choose from, and the elements go away when the user leaves the set (set cleanup event handler (element leave set))
This is how the visitor can navigate and access the area.

# Large set relations

Relationships between sets can be small, or they can be huge. Some community hubs might have thousands of set connections in each set.
It is possible to set up an element to travel through these sets and build up information, a slow type of web crawler bot,
but with more possibilities for interaction and what it can do
