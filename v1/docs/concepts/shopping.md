# Making money

# Using tokens for shopping

When someone shops, tokens can be distributed for friend lists on social media. 
The seller can arrange that the friends combine their coupons to get a good deal next time people shop.

How do people combine their coupons? They give it to their friend. 

They can give the tokens to their friend without logging in, because if they do not have an account, the tokens are still in a pool not created yet
An agent is created that will apply the ownership for those new tokens to the buyer.

However, to give it to someone else other than the buyer, they have to sign up or log in
Then, any of their tokens will be owned by them, and they can send it anywhere.
Again, this is done via an agent in the website doing this.

Ads can be served later, when traffic increases


# Charging for using the selling api

There are a few ways of making money here when running this as a selling instance:

* The person running the instance can charge a rate package for using the selling api, and set up rate limits in the actions for promotions and stores and perhaps inventory
* If the seller chooses to use the company's resources to charge real money, the company will take a small percentage of the real money given, before releasing it to the seller
* Upgrades in services, charge stores to have extra selling services
* The company can run its own promotion service, and charge for placement in promotion
* The company can charge for extra distribution (first N friends on X social networks free)
* The company can charge for extra searches (first X searches free)
* The company can charge for extra api calls in general (api calls capped by plan, including free tier)

None of these depend on the mix or real money with tokens for a purchase, or any deals the seller and customer make.
People can still use this service as they need, and enough people will use one of the above things to make a small profit off of it

# Bandwidth charges

It's going to cost the company to run data to people.

To limit the charges for sending content through the webs, any resources such as images, files, videos, pdf should be hosted elsewhere.
This service stores the urls to these

Offering a site to have people search and buy from is covered by promotion and search fees

Chat and other stuff is covered by api rates
