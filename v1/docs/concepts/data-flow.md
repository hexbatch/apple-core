# Data Flow and navigation

Tokens can move themselves though a set relationships to find the best fit.
This movement is not very fast, but it happens.

## Exploration

It's possible to set a token that drifts to find its natural balance, or to change sets according to a pattern.
Actions on the token can do a search in the current set, and report back a format, or do other things

## Mechanisms

Using the allergy and affinity, predefined tokens can route themselves through a network of set relations to find the needed destination

## Set guarding

It's possible to make sets made that require visiting other sets first before the token is allowed to come in.
This allows a traffic and control flow to be set up. And also very slow moving programs can execute this way by being tokens going through sets

## Visitors

A set can have an action that sends any entry to the set to a script or url. Because the token id is known, that is coming in, the remote can directly read or write to the visitor.
Or the visitor can be given a set of options to chose from, for commands, a command pallet, and this is how the visitor can navigate and access the area.

# Large set relations

Relationships between sets can be small, or they can be huge. Some community hubs might have thousands of set connections in each set.
It is possible to set up a token to travel through these sets and build up information, a slow type of web crawler bot,
but with more possibilities for interaction and what it can do
