# Connecting tokens with real money

Sometimes things of value can be traded, or people want tokens that represent actual money. 
Or need a token that marks a transaction successfully completed with money

Online stores and other places can use agents to create and change token state for transactions, and these tokens represent the money.

So, when a merchant offers goods for sale, and wants a mix of real money and other tokens,
the user purchasing is given a token that has a url for them to go pay, and then that token is updated when the payment goes through and the user is given a new token.
That new token is made and added to the user's set to purchase with.
Then, the token can complete the required type-set and the deal continues if all the matching tokens work out.

## Tokens representing money only work for the user made for it

A token that represents a transaction is defined by the user selling the stuff, or trading. There is no set token type for representing value.
Likewise, there is no cryptocurrency here that works out of the box.
Users can apply this as part of their own currencies though, and tokens can be part of the mechanisms that run after a transaction is made
