# Distributions

Organizes new tokens and token pools,  given to users and and network entities

Sets up mixes of token types of different amounts of tokens to be released when an awarded offer succeeds

Sets up a template to use, so that when a user buys something, then some or all of their associated-network gets the new tokens
* Their associated network can contain users who have these network identities

When a user gets the tokens, the new tokens from the pool, or the tokens taken from a set are given to them, they have ownership.

When it's a non-user network entity:
* the token sub-pool is assigned it, to be instantiated when a user claims/is assigned this entity in their identity-networks
* the tokens and pool is added as a possession set, so cannot be sold 
* the possession set can have limits to expire, and release any already created tokens, or the pool
