# Promotions

Advertisement agreements for promotion of sales inventory


* sets up the inventory to promote, and the terms
* sets up callback urls to verify the promotions were actually seen in a browser, or app
* sets up the looks and feels of the promotions
* keeps track of impressions

A campaign is for a set of inventory, which can have any relation.

The campaign has a time boundary, optional map boundaries, and promised impressions

There is a ping back when a viewer sees an advertisement or map icon, or other form of ad
 * some clustered ads, such as many map icons, will need to use aggregate posting in the same url callback to ping usage

A campaign shows media how the ads will look

A campaign is sold on the market, but can also be sold in a store

The purchaser can get metrics for performance over time. But can only ask for refunds if purchased in a store.

For example, say that I, as a user, sets up a map app on my website and agree to do X impressions in searches and map pins, etc
