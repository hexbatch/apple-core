# Memberships

Api for selling inclusion in a user group for a period of time or permanently .

Membership can be sold much like inventory

* create a membership offer 
* create an admin offer

## Membership sold in stores

Membership offers can be sold in stores, and the transaction completing allows for the user to be an admin or member.


# Membership invites 

A membership offered to bearer can also be made, whoever has a token can give (transaction) in exchange for membership.
Perhaps other tokens will also be required, that is up to whoever makes the invitation.

Because this is a token, it can also be a token pool, and also have bounds and expiration, and permissions (only some users can use it).


# Membership subscriptions

Membership can also be done as a subscription
