# Network pools

A pool can listen to a user's network entry set, and when an entry is added to a new user's identity-set, then if there is a pool reservation for that network entry, tokens are given.


Sets of associated-networks (the full set or something filtered) can be traded on the marketplace

Network Discovery is a layer that searches a network for user friends and adds them to their associated-network

# Network entities can be assigned tokens

There is a set for this network entity called the possession-set, that tokens and pools can be added to. But the ownership of the tokens is not changed until the network entity is resolved to a user.
Each network entity can have many possession sets and these sets can have expiration dates or other bounds set on them to be released at

Tokens in a possession set here cannot be sold because there is an attribute that prevents this from being added to any lot set
