# Agents

Agents are those that agree to do token changes outside the server, and report back the changes to make to the tokens.
This can be used with the export, import and verification between different servers, or do some other thing

* Agents allow users to authorize changes to their tokens done by something based not on this server.
* Agents listen to these changes of the tokens, and then updates the token attributes, or token set, or other stuff
