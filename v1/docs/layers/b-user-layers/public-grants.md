# Low level operations

Users can have permission to do low level operations directly on a token.

They must also have the permissions to do this in the core api too.

Permission can be granted to allow only a certain family of tokens , or just sets with bounds, for each user granted permission

## Grants

admin users can grant user groups access to do core operations on sets of token types

Once granted, then anything allowed in the core api can be done

grants can be removed

## operations

This is done by doing the job api, so it's still job distributed core use

# editing token descriptions

allows the user to edit token standard attributes they can write to

# creating and deleting and linking sets, and moving tokens around

allows the user to create and organize set relationships, and move tokens, or copy tokens between them
