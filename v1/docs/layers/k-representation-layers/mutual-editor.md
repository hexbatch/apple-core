# Mutual Editor

Load mutual relationships into a viewer and editor that is 3d shaped

Mutual relationships in a view can be given shapes and colors that represent the relationships;
because the relationships may be very large, a chunk of n x n tied together sets are rendered at any one time.

The user can move around the parent set of this mapping and see new chunks.

The user can interact with the shapes to change the tokens connecting the mutual sets.

The user can do mutual operations to do union and intersection and all the other ways to change a view

# existing mutual relationships

This editor can load in existing view via a search and then regular permissions allow the user to add or remove tokens to the sets that they can edit

For any tokens in the sets that can be read, the user can do aggregations

# Per user mutual relationships

As long as user can read a set, then they can add it to their own set, and link the wrapper sets in a new mutual relationship, they can unwrap too

These custom mutuals are kept as sets in their home area, in a set to store those, and then later the user can combine these views or do mutual operations on them

The custom views can be mutually operated on with the existing views from elsewhere


# selections via topology and shape of the selected area

Adds in custom mutual operations for this
