# Avatar

This allows a user to create , edit and store a map (see shapes),
The map can be altered by outside agents, so the avatar can change its part locations and move around.
Basically, if a program can move models around and link to the agent, then that program can animate the avatar

An avatar can be assigned to any set, including the user sets

When a user travels to a map, he can be a shape too, and can move around controlled by that other program.

But non-user sets can use avatars too
