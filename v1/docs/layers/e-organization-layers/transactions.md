# Transactions

The transaction layer changes ownership of tokens after an agreement between two or more people.
Transactions can be in many parts and swap more than one owner. All have to succeed for the ownership to be changed for any

The transaction layer makes an agreement to change ownership of tokens.
There can be multiple parties to the agreement token.


The creator of the transaction can delete it only if nobody has agreed yet.
A person can remove their user token if decide they changed their mind.
A transaction can be set up to have a delay or datetime to do the transaction after all signed
The transfer can happen after all agree.
While waiting, anyone who previously agreed can remove their token from the agreement.

Transactions can be set to be deleted after N time after no agreement is reached.
Transactions can be set to allow reuse by doing a new agreement, all agreements to a transaction will be linked to that


The tokens exchanged here can be more than trading, it can be part of mechanics and set new relationships

The transaction layer allows nested transactions, and each transaction can be between different users of the agreement,
If any of the nested transactions do not work out then the transaction does not happen.
And ownership of all is rolled back, the tokens removed from escrow

Escrow: Tokens that have their ownership changed, but the entire transaction chain has not finished, cannot change their ownership in a new transaction until that is done.
They are held in escrow, new/old owners do not have any special privileges, but can read/change them as a non owning user.
The escrow status once the agreement starts the transaction.

Due to allowing long pauses to complete a transaction, this is great for allowing multiserver transactions
In the internet layer, a visiting user is wrapped in a local user, so can sign that way.

## depositing

Each user getting ownership can designate a set the tokens are placed in , once the transaction completes

# discovery

Transactions can be marked as public, what that happens its pushed to the auditing api
