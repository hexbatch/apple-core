# Things

Tokens can be made to share information and to create things people participate in

These tokens can have boundaries and media put in: They can have a schedule and location they are seen


A thing is a token type that generates tokens of thing to be had. These tokens can be limited to allow only one token each per user


Things can have a restricted group, and admins, and moderators just for the thing. Tickets can be sold for a thing
* tickets are group member invitations

Things can have discussion boards, postings and feeds

Things can be used for access to an outside url or streaming service

Things can be attached to message boards as attachments

Things can hold invitations to other things, and announcements and messages to be rendered into html or other, to be delivered into people's wallet

## Locking and unlocking

Information in a thing can be encrypted. Only the users in the membership group of a thing will be given the keys to use it. 
The key will be added to their wallet sets, and viewing software can use that to show the content.

But this key can be encrypted also, in another thing, and the user must possess the key token also.

Tokens of a thing can be duplicated from an encrypted thing will use the same key, that way

## News and mail and announcements

Things can be created to deliver messages, and chat invitations, to a person's wallet.

Things can be sorted into the wallet

### Blocking and reporting and spam

Things can be reported on, can be individually blocked, and the user making the things can have a spam score, this puts their deliveries into the spam folder in a wallet

## Mixing and matching 

Things can also be created to mingle, and when together in a set create a new token, which can be a new thing token

This allows puzzles and games, as well as sets up the mechanics for notices and listeners
