# Instance Api

* Gives instance information (api here allows setting the instance info to permitted users)
* Adds or removes users from the groups that can execute commands
* Gives a list of sets a user can go to
* Allows setting up an agent with another user on another server. Then that user can send over tokens to use on the instance
* Allows instance to be rebooted, shut down, maintenance mode (not the servers, but the instance itself)
* Sets up an optional whitelist of allowed visitors, and what they can do
* Sets up tracking token changes from other servers
