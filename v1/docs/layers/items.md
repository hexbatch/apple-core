# Items

Tokens can be made to share information and to create items people participate in

These tokens can have boundaries and media put in: They can have a schedule and location they are seen


This is a token type that generates tokens of item to be had. These tokens can be limited to allow only one token each per user


Items can have a restricted group, and admins, and moderators just for the item. Tickets can be sold for a item
* tickets are group member invitations

Items can have discussion boards, postings and feeds

Items can be used for access to an outside url or streaming service

Items can be attached to message boards as attachments

Items can hold invitations to other items, and announcements and messages to be rendered into html or other, to be delivered into people's wallet

## Locking and unlocking

Information in a item can be encrypted. Only the users in the membership group of a item will be given the keys to use it. 
The key will be added to their wallet sets, and viewing software can use that to show the content.

But this key can be encrypted also, in another item, and the user must possess the key token also.

Tokens of a item can be duplicated from an encrypted item will use the same key, that way

## News and mail and announcements

Items can be created to deliver messages, and chat invitations, to a person's wallet.

Items can be sorted into the wallet

### Blocking and reporting and spam

Items can be reported on, can be individually blocked, and the user making the items can have a spam score, this puts their deliveries into the spam folder in a wallet

## Mixing and matching 

Items can also be created to mingle, and when together in a set create a new token, which can be a new item token

This allows puzzles and games, as well as sets up the mechanics for notices and listeners
