# Rates

Rates are tokens that allow the set in them to do api calls, and allows the tokens and child sets to do api calls.

Rates can be set to be total api calls made.

Rates are set by the server giving it, and cannot be used outside that server.

If there is one rate token, that token can be split into more as long as the total rate number is the same afterward

Rates can be set to have permissions to allow anything in a shape boundaries of an area to take it, or part of it.

When traveling between servers, they can set up transaction to swap rates for other rates or tokens. An instance can sell its hardward that way
