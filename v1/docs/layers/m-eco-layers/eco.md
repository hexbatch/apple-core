Ecosystems allow data to be processed for whatever reason, as well as be fun


# Plants and grazers

Plants and grazers are shaped sets in a set that is filled with editables made from conversions

Grazers can move around between sets, and the plants do not move at all.

These read the attributes in the editables, getting first tokens to tech trees

Plants do not use api for long periods, they are more efficient that way, they just wait until an editable hits it.

Plants can bud off and get out of the map, and travel to be set on the ground in another map

Grazers use much more api moving around and finding stuff.

# secondary level

Other sets look around for the plants and grazers, and enter their space and take the tech token(s) to process it further.
And they can feed on the rates.

The tech token will transfer ownership to that user when its taken. 

# higher 

A set can be both a plant and grazer and secondary level, to process the token in the same set.
Some tech tress can demand the tech token change ownership before giving a new token.

Regardless, if the set possessing the tech token cannot meet its requirements by doing the correct stuff, to be validated by the remote or script,
then there are no rewards, and they take up api usage.

Some tech tokens can give api rate increases, by possessing a token for allowing it, and api rates can be reduced for things that do not move the tech tokens.
When a set has no more api, it is removed.

Api call limits given by goals can be distributed to other sets that work together.

# selling

Plants and animals can be sold in the marketplace
