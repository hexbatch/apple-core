* Moderators: sets up and manages

## setting up moderators

* Sets up moderators for region, tags, or time, and for specific attributes they can edit
* For example, a moderator can be setup to review all feedback for sales in the livingston area. Or a moderator can review all media for a special event on Tuesday
* Can also remove or adjust moderators setup in the admin panel or in the moderator api


Moderators are very restricted admins, able to log in as some people, and change a list of attributes. Can set up each moderator type to do changes to some families of attributes.
Then assign that moderator role to specific users to supervise, or discover a pool of users to automatically gain control of some of their attributes in some sets (some contexts)
