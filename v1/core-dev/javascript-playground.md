## Javascript playground

Have way to drag around and make new stuff to explore each api call in the core
* Login using server text box, enter username and pow , use basic auth (its the core), and remember the base 64 thing to send
* Dialog to make and edit attributes
* Dialog to make and edit token types
* Tokens can be visually modified
* Drag tokens to sets
* Connect sets together by a couple of clicks
* Enter search paths, put tokens of search in new set
* Do all the set operations in easiest way possible

With the javascript playground, can also write js scripts (or copy and paste them in, to be stored as scripts to run in the core)

Can set locations and areas via maps 

Can set times via cron visualizer and dialog

Can list all the sets using a search, or limited search: results will come back as a pair of searches with the terminal set, then the selected tokens in a new set
