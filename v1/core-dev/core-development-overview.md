# Developing the core

* Write down all the api the core has, each api call has algorithm and notes. The overviews show how it all goes together
* For all layers write their api and high logic.
  * For each api call write down all the core api that the layers use and each other 
* Write the open api specs for the core and all the layers
* Write the core in php
  * There will be many tests 
* Make js wrapper library to call this via api, and make a simple but graphical way to play with the api

## Javascript playground

[javascript-playground.md](javascript-playground.md)
There will be an easy way to play and test the api in the browser
