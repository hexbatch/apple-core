All api are also represented as tokens: this is true for the core as well as the layers

All api in core and layer can have a decision set or token that will respond to "can api call be used" event, not having an event means api call can be done.

Rate limits can be enforced via the layers, but in the layers also this can be bypassed by using a decision set that has tokens of allowed api calls,
with an attribute for a counter to mark down/keep track of allowed usages. This decision set can also have user tokens for allowed users to do this for.
These sets can be traded

This is probably done by the rates.md
