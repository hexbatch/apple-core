a mutual view can be added to the set, and not for the view token only but for all the strong attributes.
They are added to the set as one, and will leave the set when the view leaves.

This is an interface of tokens

an interface is a view with a filter, or (probably?) the set that is the view because of an attribute has another attribute that points to a filter to use
When this kind of view enters the set, then it acts like an interface rather than a single set token being added.

But that sounds clunky, also need a way to add in the view as a token to a set also. Perhaps its just a mutual api call that does this? adds and removes interfaces
