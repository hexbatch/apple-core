A token can belong to any number of sets at the same time.
When two or more sets share that token, they have something in common.

What is a mutual group of sets?
    If I find a set, then discover all the sets it has one or more tokens in common.
    Then I can look at those sets, and find all the other sets they have shared tokens.
    These tokens may be different from the ones shared with the first set.
    After I do this as much as possible, or until I decide to stop including sets, then I have something called a mutual group of sets


Mutual sets have a topology. Things can be done with them and their shared tokens.
    * We can put these tokens into a new set
    * We can do group aggregation operations on the attributes of these tokens: such as sum, or counts or averages or concatenation or json operations or min or max
    * We can do these aggregations on families of these attributes or all the attributes, much like the group by in sql
    * We can do operations on these mutual sets such as union (or), intersection (and) , difference (xor), and complement (those in A not in B)
    * Because these operations do not cause events to possibly cascade into lengthy operations, we can allow for new custom mutual operations
    * We can do topology operations on these mutual sets, do overlays and superimpose them: creating new groups of mutuals or selecting common tokens for things that match up
        * For example, say I have  5 sets connected in a ring, and I match it up to a larger set of mutuals where there are some rings here and there.
            I can match to all the rings, and collect tokens there. Or I can match to just rings of 5.


Mutual operation categories:
    * Reduction of attribute values, and assign these group calculations to attributes on any token we can write. This can be dynamic or typed attributes.
    * Select some or all of the shared tokens into a new set, or search result
    * Split a mutual set, make a new mutual set from other mutuals, and combine mutual sets.
    * Discover the common bounds for all the sets in a mutual group: the pattern of time all the sets exist, or a shared area on the map
        * Do aggregation operations on the bounds in a mutual group

Selecting tokens from mutuals
    * the shared tokens are of interest and can be filtered by different priorities
    * select tokens that are shared N,M times
    * select shared tokens based on attribute types and values and ranges of values
    * after selecting, can filter by attribute or token type into different sets or sub aggregation operations


Aggregation operations:
   Any tokens in a set can be reduced and have that number applied to an attribute (new or already existing) on a token. The set can be filtered to allow for sub-group operations and reductions

Mutuals can make filters by using their aggregations and counting per family of attributes, or per attribute

Custom mutual operators : no event side effects so these operators can do anything!
    * add new selection operators to choose a mutual group
    * add new combination and other ways to manipulate groups
