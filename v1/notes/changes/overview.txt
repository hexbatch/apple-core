Core:

    Events:
        * Can send custom event, one that inherits from the custom even attribute, to any one token per api call to send event.


-------------------

    Set:

        Set parents are in the child as a token, just as the child is in the parent as a token
           Removing either breaks the parent child relationship
           Relationships for sets are still also defined by special defined attribute
