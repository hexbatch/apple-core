Core:


    Types:
            token types can have live attributes that apply to all the tokens (but not the type itself)
                * changes for all tokens and can overwrite inherited on the tokens
                * live attributes put on the tokens can overwrite an attribute already there, by design or later action.
                * no limit to how many live attributes that overwrite the earlier one. They stack by when applied.
            need discussion about attributes able to overwrite their parents. If I have A inherits from B, and C inherits from B
                if a token has B, and I add a live of A, then that overwrites the B. However if I add C, then that does not overwrite B (B is not a child of A)
            scripts and remotes should have their storage as live token level attributes,
                but not sure how that works with the attribute value being a script and not the state for the script (remote too)

            Can add attribute to type or live when attribute is both readable and writable. Do not have to own attribute (this causes some changes in sketched out ntoes)


-------------------

    Live tokens:

        * Live attributes can be added to a type, and that is used only for the tokens created by that type
-------------------

    Events:
        * Can send custom event, one that inherits from the custom even attribute, to any one token per api call to send event.
        * Can have a read event. Cycles prevented by new api mechanisms

        * Can have an event for applying or removing a live attribute, on the type level, for all tokens.
          * same event can be on the per token
          * same can be for live added or removed in a set context (the live cannot be seen outside that set)
          * can have one event for all three also

-------------------

    Set:

        Set parents are in the child as a token, just as the child is in the parent as a token
           Removing either breaks the parent child relationship
           Relationships for sets are still also defined by special defined attribute
